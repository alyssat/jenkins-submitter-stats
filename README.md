# Jenkins contribution statistics

A set of tools to extract and analyze the number of software contributions and their submitter.
This is a strict interpretation of "contribution". Other statistics (lile those from the Linux Foundation), analyse *all* interactions with a project (PR, comment, issue creation, review).
